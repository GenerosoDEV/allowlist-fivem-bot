# ✅ FiveM Allowlist Discord Bot
This is a custom Discord bot built to manage allowlist access for a FiveM server, based on Discord role assignments.
The bot automatically assigns a specific role to approved users, which then grants them access to the server via allowlist integration.

Developed with discord.py, it was intended to streamline role-based allowlisting for FiveM communities.
